# MusicMaker
Program for generating music with accompanying sheet music and audio.

To run, download all files into one directory. If not already installed, install Python Imaging Library (PIL) by running "pip install Pillow" within the Terminal / Command Prompt (recommended) or download from http://python-pillow.org/. Then, simply run the MusicMaker.py code within Python 3. Sheet music .jpg are generated within the Sheet Music folder, and audio .wav files are generated within the Audio Files folder.

Future developments I hope to implement: More key signature options, more time signatures, incidental note support, GUI for selecting notes from a piano, notation improvements (e.g. stem directions,dynamic/tempo markings), MIDI support, variable tempo, more instrumentation options
